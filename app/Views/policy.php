            <strong>Privacy Technology Practices</strong><br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Do Not Track Signals</strong><br>
            Some browsers have incorporated “do not track” features to enable users to make privacy and security choices. By using these settings, your browser may send a signal to our Site not to collect tracking information. Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a “do not track” signal from your browser.
            Unless subject to a separate written agreement with us, Pepicase does not claim ownership of Your Content. However, you grant us and our service providers a worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works from, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, make and have made your Content (in any form and any medium, whether now known or later developed) in connection with the Services.
            Except with respect to Your Content, Pepicase and our licensors own all right, title, and interest in the Services and all Content and other materials within the Service. The Pepicase logos and trademarks referenced in the Services are the trademarks of Pepicase and our affiliates. Any other company names, product names, service names, and logos referenced in the Services may be the trademarks of their respective owners. Pepicase reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
            To the extent the Services provide access to any online software or other similar components, then Pepicase grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the software or components only in connection with the Services.
            <br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Data Security</strong><br>
            We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. Depending on the circumstances, we may hold your information in hard copy and/or electronic form. For each medium, we use technologies and procedures to protect Personal Information. We review our strategies and update as necessary to meet our business needs, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements. These measures include without limitation technical and organizational security policies and procedures, security controls, and employee training.
            If you make any purchases through the Services, we may use a third-party payment processor (e.g., PayPal, Amazon Pay, ShopPay, Afterpay, or Stripe) to assist with securely processing your payment information, and your credit card data will be encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information will be deleted.
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials that related to the Services. We will treat access to the Services through your account credentials as authorized by you. Unauthorized access to password-protected or secure areas is prohibited. We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately using the contact information provided below.
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.
            <br>
            <strong>DO NOT SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
            TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PEPICASE PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF PEPICASE PARTIES HAD ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PEPICASE PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $25 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO PEPICASE FOR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES (OR PORTION THEREOF) AT ISSUE WITHIN THE 6 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE APPLICABLE CLAIM AROSE. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY RESULTING FROM PEPICASE PARTIES’ GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT.
            o notify Pepicase not to “Sell or Share My Personal Information,” please click here. In this case “sharing” refers to a specific type of disclosure under certain privacy laws that relates to advertising activity including targeted advertising. An example of a sale or share of information is when we disclose information about you (like when you have visited our Site) tied to unique identifiers, like device IDs, with third parties for targeted advertising. When you tell us not to sell or share your Personal Information, we will not disclose your personal data for these purposes. Please note that not all disclosures of your Personal Information constitute a “share” or “sale” of your data under applicable privacy laws.
            <br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Right to Know</strong><br>
            You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your Personal Information during the past 12 months.<br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Right to Access</strong><br>
            You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we maintain about you.<br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Right to Delete</strong><br>      
            You may request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.<br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Right to Correct</strong><br>
            You may request that we correct any of your Personal Information that has become outdated or needs correction for any reason.<br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Exercising Your Rights</strong><br>
            To access or delete specific pieces of Personal Information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. As permitted by applicable law, any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (a “Verifiable Consumer Request”). We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected Personal Information. California, Colorado and Virginia residents may exercise their rights described above by emailing us at privacy@getcasely.com with subject line “Verifiable Consumer Request.”
            Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (an “Authorized Agent”), may make a request to know or delete related to your personal data. We require Authorized Agents to provide written authorization confirming they may submit a request on your behalf. You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. We endeavor to substantively respond to a Verifiable Consumer Request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt, unless we require an extension. If we reasonably require an extension, we will inform you of the reason and extension period.
            Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will review your request. We may deny your request if retaining the information is proper and necessary or if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. If we deny your request, you may submit an appeal. Instructions for how to submit your appeal will be included in our response explaining why we denied your request.
            <br>
            <strong style="font-size:20px">Non-Discrimination</strong><br>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your data subject rights. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Verifiable Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
